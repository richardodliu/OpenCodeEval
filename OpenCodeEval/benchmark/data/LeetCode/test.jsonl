Special case: If the starting and target cells are the same, we need to check if `t` is not equal to 1 because we must move every second.\n\nLet's implement this logic in the `isReachableAtTime` method:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def isReachableAtTime(self, sx: int, sy: int, fx: int, fy: int, t: int) -> bool:\n        # Calculate the Chebyshev distance\n        distance = max(abs(sx - fx), abs(sy - fy))\n        \n        # Special case: if the starting and target cells are the same\n        if sx == fx and sy == fy:\n            # We cannot stay in the same place for exactly 1 second\n            return t != 1\n        \n        # Check if we can reach the target in exactly t seconds\n        return t >= distance\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently checks the conditions and returns the correct result based on the given constraints.", "split": "test"}}

Each key in the dictionary represents a node, and the corresponding value is a list of its neighbors.\n  \n- **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function calculates the sum of values for the subtree rooted at the current node. It starts with the value of the current node and recursively adds the values of its children (excluding the parent to avoid cycles).\n\n- **Counting Valid Components**: After calculating the sum of values for a subtree, we check if it is divisible by `k`. If it is, we increment the `valid_components` counter and return `0` to reset the sum for further calculations. Otherwise, we return the total sum of the subtree.\n\n- **Starting DFS**: We start the DFS from node `0` (or any node, since the tree is connected). The parent of the starting node is set to `-1` to indicate that there is no parent.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count the maximum number of valid components in the tree.", "split": "test"}}

This is stored in `path_weights`.\n\n4. **Binary Lifting for LCA**: We use binary lifting to preprocess the tree for efficient Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries.\n\n5. **LCA Query**: For each query, we find the LCA of the two nodes and use the precomputed information to determine the minimum number of operations required to make all edge weights on the path equal.\n\nThis approach ensures that each query is answered efficiently, even for large trees and a large number of queries.", "split": "test"}}

Therefore, to minimize the sum of the scores of the subarrays, we should try to create subarrays where the AND operation results in the smallest possible values.\n\nThe smallest possible value for the AND operation is `0`. If we can find subarrays where the AND of all elements in the subarray is `0`, we should do so. This is because `0` will not increase the sum of scores, and it allows us to maximize the number of subarrays.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Calculate the bitwise AND of the entire array. If this value is `0`, then it means we can potentially split the array into multiple subarrays where each subarray's AND is `0`.\n2. If the bitwise AND of the entire array is not `0`, then the minimum sum of scores we can achieve is the AND of the entire array, and we can only have one subarray.\n3. To find the maximum number of subarrays with an AND of `0`, we can iterate through the array and keep a running AND.

Whenever the running AND becomes `0`, it increments the count of subarrays and resets the running AND for the next subarray.", "split": "test"}}

The idea is to use the stack to keep track of indices of elements in a decreasing order.\n\n3. **Find Left Boundary**: Traverse the array from left to right and use a stack to find the rightmost index `l` such that `nums[l]` is greater than `nums[i]`.\n\n4. **Find Right Boundary**: Traverse the array from right to left and use a stack to find the leftmost index `r` such that `nums[r]` is greater than `nums[i]`.\n\n5. **Calculate the Length**: The length of the subarray for `nums[i]` is `r - l - 1`.\n\nHere is the complete implementation of the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumLengthOfRanges(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        n = len(nums)\n        ans = [0] * n\n        \n        # Initialize left and right boundaries with default values\n        left = [-1] * n  # left[i] will store the largest index j < i such that nums[j] > nums[i]\n        right = [n] * n  # right[i] will store the smallest index j > i such that nums[j] > nums[i]\n        \n        # Stack to find left boundaries\n        stack = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            while stack and nums[stack[-1]] < nums[i]:\n                stack.pop()\n            if stack:\n                left[i] = stack[-1]\n            stack.append(i)\n        \n        # Clear the stack for reuse\n        stack = []\n        \n        # Stack to find right boundaries\n        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n            while stack and nums[stack[-1]] < nums[i]:\n                stack.pop()\n            if stack:\n                right[i] = stack[-1]\n            stack.append(i)\n        \n        # Calculate the maximum length of ranges\n        for i in range(n):\n            ans[i] = right[i] - left[i] - 1\n        \n        return ans\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Left Boundary Calculation**: We use a stack to keep track of indices in a decreasing order of their corresponding values. For each `nums[i]`, we pop from the stack until we find an element greater than `nums[i]`. The top of the stack gives us the left boundary.\n- **Right Boundary Calculation**: Similarly, we traverse the array from right to left to find the right boundary.\n- **Result Calculation**: The length of the subarray for each element is determined by the difference between the right and left boundaries.\n\nThis approach ensures that each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n).", "split": "test"}}

It calculates the total moves required for each possible move and keeps track of the minimum.\n\n- **Backtracking**: After trying a move, the function backtracks by restoring the grid to its previous state before the move.\n\nThis approach ensures that we explore all possible ways to move stones and find the one with the minimum number of moves.

To form the smallest number, we need to sort these digits in ascending order.\n\n4. **Checking for Validity**: If we cannot fully factorize `n` using digits from 2 to 9, it means it's not possible to form such a number, and we should return \"-1\".\n\nHere's the complete code:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def smallestNumber(self, n: int) -> str:\n        if n < 10:\n            return str(n)\n        \n        # List to store the digits\n        digits = []\n        \n        # Try to factorize n using digits from 9 to 2\n        for d in range(9, 1, -1):\n            while n % d == 0:\n                digits.append(d)\n                n //= d\n        \n        # If n is not 1, it means we couldn't fully factorize it\n        if n != 1:\n            return \"-1\"\n        \n        # Sort the digits to form the smallest number\n        digits.sort()\n        \n        # Convert list of digits to a string\n        return ''.join(map(str, digits))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We iterate from 9 down to 2 to find the largest possible factors first, which helps in minimizing the number of digits.\n- We keep dividing `n` by the current digit `d` as long as `n` is divisible by `d`, appending `d` to our list of digits.\n- If after all this, `n` is not reduced to 1, it means `n` has a prime factor greater than 9, and thus, it's not possible to form such a number.\n- Finally, we sort the digits to form the smallest possible number and return it as a string.", "split": "test"}}

Additionally, each element in `heights` must be less than or equal to the corresponding element in `maxHeights`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Peak Position**: We need to determine the peak position `i` in the mountain array.

It keeps track of the distance from the start node and the distance from the cycle. If a node is revisited and is part of the current stack, it identifies a cycle.\n\n- **Cycle Identification**: After the DFS traversal, nodes that are part of a cycle are marked in `in_cycle`, and their cycle lengths are stored in `cycle_length`.\n\n- **Result Calculation**: For each node, if it is not part of a cycle, we traverse to the cycle and count the number of nodes visited until we reach the cycle. The result for nodes in the same path to the cycle is then filled in using the cycle length.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the number of unique nodes visited for each starting node in the graph.", "split": "test"}}

If it is, we add the current index to `selected_indices`.\n- After constructing the list of selected indices, we use a list comprehension to extract the corresponding words from the `words` array.\n\nThis approach ensures that we get the longest alternating subsequence of words based on the `groups` array.", "split": "test"}}

The operation involves choosing two elements `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` and updating them to `nums[i] AND nums[j]` and `nums[i] OR nums[j]`, respectively. The key observation here is that the bitwise OR operation will set a bit to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits of the operands is 1, while the bitwise AND operation will set a bit to 1 only if both corresponding bits of the operands are 1.\n\nGiven this operation, we can deduce that the operation will eventually concentrate the 1-bits from all numbers into a few numbers. Specifically, after performing the operation sufficiently many times, we can end up with numbers that have fewer 1-bits, but these 1-bits will be distributed in a way that maximizes the sum of squares of `k` numbers.\n\nThe strategy is to count the number of 1-bits at each bit position across all numbers. Then, we can construct the `k` largest numbers by distributing these 1-bits optimally. The largest possible numbers will have the most 1-bits, and we should aim to construct these numbers to maximize the sum of their squares.\n\nHere's the complete Python code to implement this solution:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maxSum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        \n        # Count the number of 1-bits at each bit position\n        bit_count = Counter()\n        for num in nums:\n            bit_position = 0\n            while num > 0:\n                if num & 1:\n                    bit_count[bit_position] += 1\n                num >>= 1\n                bit_position += 1\n        \n        # Construct the k largest numbers\n        max_sum = 0\n        for _ in range(k):\n            current_number = 0\n            for bit_position in range(bit_count.most_common()):\n                if bit_count[bit_position[0]] > 0:\n                    current_number |= (1 << bit_position[0])\n                    bit_count[bit_position[0]] -= 1\n            max_sum = (max_sum + current_number * current_number) % MOD\n        \n        return max_sum\n```\n\nHowever, the above code has a mistake in the loop where it constructs the `k` largest numbers. We should iterate over all possible bit positions, not just the most common ones. Here's the corrected version:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maxSum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        \n        # Count the number of 1-bits at each bit position\n        bit_count = Counter()\n        max_bit_position = 0\n        for num in nums:\n            bit_position = 0\n            while num > 0:\n                if num & 1:\n                    bit_count[bit_position] += 1\n                    max_bit_position = max(max_bit_position, bit_position)\n                num >>= 1\n                bit_position += 1\n        \n        # Construct the k largest numbers\n        max_sum = 0\n        for _ in range(k):\n            current_number = 0\n            for bit_position in range(max_bit_position + 1):\n                if bit_count[bit_position] > 0:\n                    current_number |= (1 << bit_position)\n                    bit_count[bit_position] -= 1\n            max_sum = (max_sum + current_number * current_number) % MOD\n        \n        return max_sum\n```\n\nThis code correctly counts the number of 1-bits at each bit position and constructs the `k` largest numbers by distributing the 1-bits optimally.

The conditions for them to meet are that Alice must be in a building with a smaller height than the target building, and Bob must also be in a building with a smaller height than the target building, and the target building must be to the right of both Alice and Bob's starting buildings.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify Directly Reachable Buildings**: If Alice and Bob are already in buildings where Alice's building is to the left of Bob's and Alice's building is shorter than Bob's, then they can meet in Bob's building. Similarly, if Bob's building is to the left of Alice's and Bob's building is shorter than Alice's, they can meet in Alice's building.\n\n2. **Handle Same Building Queries**: If Alice and Bob are already in the same building, they can meet there immediately.\n\n3. **Use a Monotonic Stack**: For each query where the above conditions are not met, we can use a monotonic stack to find the next taller building for each building. This will help us quickly determine the next building where Alice and Bob can meet.\n\n4. **Process Queries**: For each query, use the precomputed next taller buildings to find the leftmost building where Alice and Bob can meet.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above logic:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def leftmostBuildingQueries(self, heights: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:\n        n = len(heights)\n        next_taller = [n] * n  # Initialize with n, meaning no taller building to the right\n        stack = []\n        \n        # Fill next_taller array using a monotonic stack\n        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n            while stack and heights[i] >= heights[stack[-1]]:\n                stack.pop()\n            if stack:\n                next_taller[i] = stack[-1]\n            stack.append(i)\n        \n        ans = []\n        for ai, bi in queries:\n            if ai > bi:\n                ai, bi = bi, ai\n            if ai == bi or heights[ai] < heights[bi]:\n                ans.append(bi)\n            else:\n                i = next_taller[bi]\n                while i < n and heights[i] <= heights[ai]:\n                    i = next_taller[i]\n                ans.append(i if i < n else -1)\n        \n        return ans\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Monotonic Stack**: We use a stack to keep track of buildings in decreasing order of their heights. This helps us find the next taller building for each building efficiently.\n\n- **Processing Queries**: For each query, we first ensure that `ai` is the leftmost building and `bi` is the rightmost building. If Alice and Bob can meet immediately (either in the same building or if Alice's building is shorter and to the left of Bob's building), we append `bi` to the result. Otherwise, we use the `next_taller` array to find the next building where both Alice and Bob can meet.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the leftmost building where Alice and Bob can meet for each query.", "split": "test"}}

A subsequence is balanced if the difference between consecutive elements in the subsequence satisfies a specific condition.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Reformulate the Condition**: The condition `nums[ij] - nums[ij-1] >= ij - ij-1` can be rewritten as `nums[ij] - ij >= nums[ij-1] - ij-1`. This suggests that we can transform the problem into finding the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in terms of the values `nums[i] - i`.\n\n2. **Use a Data Structure for Efficient Queries**: We can use a data structure that allows us to efficiently query and update the maximum value of a subsequence ending at a certain point. A Segment Tree or a Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) can be used for this purpose.\n\n3. **Iterate and Update**: For each element in `nums`, calculate the transformed value `nums[i] - i`. Use the data structure to find the maximum sum of a balanced subsequence that can be extended by the current element, and update the data structure with the new value.\n\n4. **Return the Result**: The result will be the maximum value found during the iteration, which represents the maximum sum of a balanced subsequence.\n\nHere's the complete implementation using a Segment Tree:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass SegmentTree:\n    def __init__(self, n):\n        self.n = n\n        self.tree = [0] * (4 * n)\n    \n    def query(self, left, right, node, qleft, qright):\n        if qright < left or qleft > right:\n            return float('-inf')\n        if qleft <= left and right <= qright:\n            return self.tree[node]\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        left_val = self.query(left, mid, 2 * node + 1, qleft, qright)\n        right_val = self.query(mid + 1, right, 2 * node + 2, qleft, qright)\n        return max(left_val, right_val)\n    \n    def update(self, left, right, node, index, value):\n        if index < left or index > right:\n            return\n        if left == right:\n            self.tree[node] = max(self.tree[node], value)\n            return\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        self.update(left, mid, 2 * node + 1, index, value)\n        self.update(mid + 1, right, 2 * node + 2, index, value)\n        self.tree[node] = max(self.tree[2 * node + 1], self.tree[2 * node + 2])\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maxBalancedSubsequenceSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        if n == 0:\n            return 0\n        \n        # Coordinate compression for the transformed values\n        transformed_values = [nums[i] - i for i in range(n)]\n        sorted_values = sorted(set(transformed_values))\n        value_to_index = {value: index for index, value in enumerate(sorted_values)}\n        \n        segment_tree = SegmentTree(len(sorted_values))\n        max_sum = float('-inf')\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            transformed = nums[i] - i\n            index = value_to_index[transformed]\n            # Query the maximum sum of subsequences ending before the current transformed value\n            max_prev_sum = segment_tree.query(0, segment_tree.n - 1, 0, 0, index)\n            # Calculate the current maximum sum\n            current_max_sum = max(nums[i], max_prev_sum + nums[i])\n            # Update the segment tree\n            segment_tree.update(0, segment_tree.n - 1, 0, index, current_max_sum)\n            # Update the overall maximum sum\n            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_max_sum)\n        \n        return max_sum\n```\n\nThis solution uses a Segment Tree to efficiently query and update the maximum sum of balanced subsequences, ensuring that the overall time complexity is manageable.", "split": "test"}}

The minimum cost for a subtree rooted at a node `u` is the minimum of:\n   - The value of node `u` itself (if we set it to zero, we need to ensure the rest of the subtree is healthy).\n   - The sum of the minimum costs of all its children (if we keep the value of node `u` and make sure each child subtree is healthy).\n4. **Calculate Maximum Score**: The maximum score is the total sum of all node values minus the minimum cost to make the entire tree healthy.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumScoreAfterOperations(self, edges: List[List[int]], values: List[int]) -> int:\n        from collections import defaultdict\n        \n        # Build the adjacency list for the tree\n        graph = defaultdict(list)\n        for u, v in edges:\n            graph[u].append(v)\n            graph[v].append(u)\n        \n        def dfs(u, parent):\n            # Base case: if the node is a leaf, the minimum cost to keep it healthy is its value\n            if len(graph[u]) == 1 and u != 0:\n                return values[u]\n            \n            # Calculate the sum of minimum costs for all children\n            min_cost = 0\n            for v in graph[u]:\n                if v != parent:\n                    min_cost += dfs(v, u)\n            \n            # The minimum cost to keep the subtree rooted at u healthy\n            return min(values[u], min_cost)\n        \n        # Calculate the total sum of all node values\n        total_sum = sum(values)\n        \n        # Calculate the minimum cost to make the tree healthy\n        min_cost_to_keep_healthy = dfs(0, -1)\n        \n        # The maximum score is the total sum minus the minimum cost to keep the tree healthy\n        return total_sum - min_cost_to_keep_healthy\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Graph Construction**: We use an adjacency list to represent the tree.\n- **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function calculates the minimum cost to make the subtree rooted at a given node healthy. It recursively calculates the cost for each child and returns the minimum of the node's value or the sum of the costs of its children.\n- **Total Sum and Minimum Cost**: We calculate the total sum of all node values and subtract the minimum cost to keep the tree healthy to get the maximum score.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the score while keeping the tree healthy according to the given constraints.", "split": "test"}}

A strong pair `(x, y)` satisfies the condition `|x - y| <= min(x, y)`. We can iterate through all possible pairs and check if they form a strong pair, then compute their XOR and keep track of the maximum XOR value found.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumStrongPairXor(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        max_xor = 0\n        nums.sort()  # Sorting helps in reducing unnecessary comparisons\n        \n        # Iterate through each pair\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            for j in range(i, len(nums)):\n                x, y = nums[i], nums[j]\n                if abs(x - y) <= min(x, y):\n                    max_xor = max(max_xor, x ^ y)\n        \n        return max_xor\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Sorting**: We sort the array `nums` to help in reducing unnecessary comparisons. If `x` and `y` are such that `x < y`, and `|x - y| > min(x, y)`, then for any `z > y`, `|x - z|` will also be greater than `min(x, z)`. This allows us to break out of the inner loop early in some cases.\n\n2. **Iterate through pairs**: We use two nested loops to consider all pairs `(x, y)` where `x <= y`. This is because the condition `|x - y| <= min(x, y)` is symmetric, and sorting helps in ensuring that we only consider pairs in non-decreasing order.\n\n3. **Check strong pair condition**: For each pair `(x, y)`, we check if it satisfies the strong pair condition `|x - y| <= min(x, y)`. If it does, we compute the XOR of `x` and `y` and update `max_xor` if this XOR is greater than the current `max_xor`.\n\n4. **Return the result**: After checking all pairs, we return the maximum XOR value found.\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of `O(n^2)` due to the nested loops, which is feasible for moderate-sized arrays.

A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards, so for a string `s` of length `n`, `s[i]` must be equal to `s[n-1-i]` for all `i`.\n\nGiven the constraints and the operations allowed, we can use a frequency count approach to determine if it's possible to make the string a palindrome. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We have a string `s` of even length `n`. We can rearrange characters in two non-overlapping substrings: one in the first half of the string (`s[ai:bi]`) and one in the second half (`s[ci:di]`).\n\n2. **Palindrome Condition**: For `s` to be a palindrome, `s[i]` must equal `s[n-1-i]` for all `i`.\n\n3. **Character Frequency Count**: We can count the frequency of each character in the first half and the second half of the string. To make the string a palindrome, the frequency of each character in the first half must match the frequency of the same character in the second half.\n\n4. **Adjustable Ranges**: We can adjust the frequencies within the specified ranges `[ai:bi]` and `[ci:di]`. This means we can swap characters within these ranges to balance the frequencies.\n\n5. **Implementation**: For each query, we will:\n   - Count the frequency of characters in the entire first half and second half.\n   - Identify the mismatched characters and their counts.\n   - Check if the mismatched characters can be rearranged within the given ranges to balance the frequencies.\n\nHere's the implementation of the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nclass Solution:\n    def canMakePalindromeQueries(self, s: str, queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[bool]:\n        n = len(s)\n        half_n = n // 2\n        \n        def can_balance(freq1, freq2, a, b, c, d):\n            # Create a frequency counter for the mismatched characters\n            diff = Counter()\n            for char in freq1:\n                if freq1[char] != freq2[char]:\n                    diff[char] += freq1[char] - freq2[char]\n            \n            # Collect the characters that need to be balanced\n            to_balance = []\n            for char, count in diff.items():\n                if count > 0:\n                    to_balance.append((char, count))\n                elif count < 0:\n                    to_balance.append((char, -count))\n            \n            # Check if we can balance the characters within the given ranges\n            for char, count in to_balance:\n                if count > 0:\n                    # We need count of char in [a, b] and [c, d]\n                    count_in_first_half = sum(1 for i in range(a, b + 1) if s[i] == char)\n                    count_in_second_half = sum(1 for i in range(c, d + 1) if s[i] == char)\n                    \n                    if count_in_first_half + count_in_second_half < count:\n                        return False\n            return True\n        \n        results = []\n        for ai, bi, ci, di in queries:\n            # Count frequencies in the first half and second half\n            freq_first_half = Counter(s[:half_n])\n            freq_second_half = Counter(s[half_n:])\n            \n            # Check if we can balance the frequencies within the given ranges\n            result = can_balance(freq_first_half, freq_second_half, ai, bi, ci, di)\n            results.append(result)\n        \n        return results\n```\n\nThis solution uses a helper function `can_balance` to determine if the character frequencies can be balanced within the specified ranges. It counts the mismatches and checks if the available characters within the ranges can be rearranged to fix these mismatches.", "split": "test"}}

There can be up to three nearest palindromic numbers: the largest palindromic number less than or equal to the median, the smallest palindromic number greater than or equal to the median, and the nearest palindromic number that is not the median itself (if it exists).\n\n3. **Calculate Costs**: Calculate the total cost for each of these palindromic numbers and return the minimum cost.\n\n4. **Helper Function to Check Palindrome**: Implement a helper function to check if a number is a palindrome.\n\nHere's the complete code implementing the above logic:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumCost(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        def is_palindrome(x: int) -> bool:\n            s = str(x)\n            return s == s[::-1]\n        \n        def find_nearest_palindromes(x: int):\n            # Find the largest palindromic number <= x\n            low = x\n            while not is_palindrome(low):\n                low -= 1\n            \n            # Find the smallest palindromic number >= x\n            high = x\n            while not is_palindrome(high):\n                high += 1\n            \n            return low, high\n        \n        # Step 1: Find the median of the array\n        nums.sort()\n        n = len(nums)\n        median = nums[n // 2] if n % 2 == 1 else (nums[n // 2 - 1] + nums[n // 2]) // 2\n        \n        # Step 2: Find the nearest palindromic numbers to the median\n        low, high = find_nearest_palindromes(median)\n        \n        # Step 3: Calculate the cost for each nearest palindromic number\n        def calculate_cost(target: int) -> int:\n            return sum(abs(num - target) for num in nums)\n        \n        cost_low = calculate_cost(low)\n        cost_high = calculate_cost(high)\n        \n        # Step 4: Return the minimum cost\n        return min(cost_low, cost_high)\n\n# Example usage:\n# sol = Solution()\n# print(sol.minimumCost([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Example input\n```\n\nThis code first finds the median of the array, then determines the nearest palindromic numbers to this median, and finally calculates the cost for each of these palindromic numbers, returning the minimum cost.", "split": "test"}}

If there are multiple ways to change a character to another, we take the minimum cost.\n\n3. **Self-Distance**: We set the distance from each character to itself to 0.\n\n4. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: We use this algorithm to compute the shortest paths between all pairs of characters. This step ensures that `dist[i][j]` contains the minimum cost to change character `i` to character `j`.\n\n5. **Calculating Total Cost**: We iterate over the `source` and `target` strings, and for each pair of characters, we add the cost of changing the source character to the target character to the total cost. If any character change is not possible (i.e., `dist[i][j]` is still infinity), we return -1.\n\nThis approach ensures that we find the minimum cost to convert the source string to the target string, or determine if it's impossible.", "split": "test"}}

If we repeatedly apply this operation, the smallest non-zero number in the array will be the GCD of all the numbers in the array.\n\n2. **Minimum Length**: If the GCD of the array is 1, we can reduce the entire array to a single element (1) by repeatedly applying the operation. This is because any number modulo 1 is 0, and we can keep reducing the array until only one element (1) remains.\n\n3. **Counting Occurrences of GCD**: If the GCD of the array is greater than 1, we need to count how many times this GCD appears in the array. The minimum length of the array will be the ceiling of half the count of the GCD, because we can pair up these GCD elements to reduce them to a single GCD element.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**: If the array contains only one element, the minimum length is 1.

A number has a trailing zero in binary if its least significant bit (LSB) is zero. \n\nFor the bitwise OR of two numbers to have a trailing zero, both numbers must have a zero in their least significant bit. Therefore, we need to check if there are at least two numbers in the array that are even (since even numbers have a zero in their LSB).\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def hasTrailingZeros(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:\n        # Count the number of even numbers in the list\n        even_count = sum(1 for num in nums if num % 2 == 0)\n        \n        # If there are at least two even numbers, return True\n        return even_count >= 2\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Count Even Numbers**: We iterate through the list and count how many numbers are even. An even number is one that is divisible by 2 (`num % 2 == 0`).\n2. **Check Condition**: If there are at least two even numbers, then it is possible to select two numbers whose bitwise OR will have a trailing zero.

This allows us to quickly look up the frequency of any character in any prefix of the string.\n\n- **Query Processing**: For each query, we use the precomputed frequencies to determine the frequency of each character in the specified range `[li, ri]`. We then calculate the number of same-end substrings using the combination formula.\n\nThis approach ensures that each query is processed efficiently, leveraging the precomputed data to achieve a time complexity of O(N + Q * |Σ|), where N is the length of the string, Q is the number of queries, and |Σ| is the size of the alphabet.", "split": "test"}}

This includes:\n     - Subarrays completely within the prefix.\n     - Subarrays completely within the suffix.\n     - Subarrays that span across the prefix and suffix, but not including the middle part that needs to be removed to maintain the increasing order.\n\nHere's the implementation of the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def incremovableSubarrayCount(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        \n        # Step 1: Find the longest increasing prefix\n        left = 0\n        while left + 1 < n and nums[left] < nums[left + 1]:\n            left += 1\n        \n        # If the whole array is strictly increasing\n        if left == n - 1:\n            return (n * (n + 1)) // 2\n        \n        # Step 2: Find the longest increasing suffix\n        right = n - 1\n        while right - 1 >= 0 and nums[right - 1] < nums[right]:\n            right -= 1\n        \n        # Step 3: Count subarrays\n        # 1. Subarrays completely within the prefix\n        count = left + 1\n        \n        # 2. Subarrays completely within the suffix\n        count += n - right + 1\n        \n        # 3. Subarrays that span across the prefix and suffix\n        # We need to find the longest subarray that can be removed\n        # such that nums[0:left+1] and nums[right:] are connected\n        i, j = left, right\n        while i >= 0 and j < n:\n            if nums[i] < nums[j]:\n                count += j - right + 1\n                i -= 1\n            else:\n                j += 1\n        \n        return count\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Longest Increasing Prefix**: We find the longest prefix that is strictly increasing. This is done by iterating from the start and checking if the next element is greater than the current one.\n- **Longest Increasing Suffix**: Similarly, we find the longest suffix that is strictly increasing by iterating from the end.\n- **Counting Subarrays**:\n  - **Prefix Subarrays**: All subarrays within the prefix are valid.\n  - **Suffix Subarrays**: All subarrays within the suffix are valid.\n  - **Crossing Subarrays**: We use a two-pointer technique to find valid subarrays that span across the prefix and suffix. We ensure that the elements in the prefix are less than the elements in the suffix to maintain the strictly increasing order.\n\nThis approach ensures that we count all possible incremovable subarrays efficiently.", "split": "test"}}

This helps in counting the valid subarrays.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Handle cases where the entire array is strictly increasing.\n   - Handle cases where the prefix and suffix overlap.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def incremovableSubarrayCount(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        \n        # Find the longest strictly increasing prefix\n        prefix_end = 0\n        while prefix_end < n - 1 and nums[prefix_end] < nums[prefix_end + 1]:\n            prefix_end += 1\n        \n        # If the entire array is strictly increasing\n        if prefix_end == n - 1:\n            return n * (n + 1) // 2\n        \n        # Find the longest strictly increasing suffix\n        suffix_start = n - 1\n        while suffix_start > 0 and nums[suffix_start] > nums[suffix_start - 1]:\n            suffix_start -= 1\n        \n        # Count subarrays that can be removed\n        # Subarrays that are completely within the prefix or suffix\n        count = (prefix_end + 1) + (n - suffix_start) + 1\n        \n        # Use two pointers to find valid subarrays\n        i, j = 0, suffix_start\n        while i <= prefix_end and j < n:\n            if nums[i] < nums[j]:\n                # All subarrays starting from i+1 to j are valid\n                count += (n - j)\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                j += 1\n        \n        return count\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Prefix and Suffix**: We first determine the longest strictly increasing prefix and suffix.\n- **Counting Subarrays**:\n  - We count all subarrays that are completely within the prefix or suffix.\n  - We also count the subarray that is the entire array itself.\n  - We use a two-pointer technique to count subarrays that start in the prefix and end in the suffix, ensuring the remaining array is strictly increasing.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count all possible incremovable subarrays.", "split": "test"}}

The houses are nodes, and the streets are edges. There is a direct edge between each pair of consecutive houses, and an additional edge between houses `x` and `y`.\n\n2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: To find the shortest path between any two houses, we can use BFS. BFS is ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\n\n3. **Counting Pairs**: For each house, we will perform a BFS to find the shortest distance to all other houses. We will count how many times each distance `k` appears across all BFS results.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**: We need to handle the case where `x` and `y` are the same, which means there is no additional direct connection.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countOfPairs(self, n: int, x: int, y: int) -> List[int]:\n        # Initialize the result array\n        result = [0] * n\n        \n        # Function to perform BFS and count distances\n        def bfs(start):\n            visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n            queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (current node, distance)\n            visited[start] = True\n            \n            while queue:\n                node, dist = queue.popleft()\n                if dist > 0:\n                    result[dist - 1] += 1  # Increment the count for this distance\n                \n                # Explore neighbors\n                neighbors = [node - 1, node + 1]\n                if node == x:\n                    neighbors.append(y)\n                if node == y:\n                    neighbors.append(x)\n                \n                for neighbor in neighbors:\n                    if 1 <= neighbor <= n and not visited[neighbor]:\n                        visited[neighbor] = True\n                        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))\n        \n        # Perform BFS from each house\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            bfs(i)\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **BFS Function**: The `bfs` function starts from a given house and explores all reachable houses using BFS. It keeps track of the distance from the start house to each other house.\n  \n- **Neighbors**: For each house, its neighbors are the houses directly connected by streets.

We update this array during each BFS traversal.\n\n- **Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) because we perform a BFS from each of the `n` houses, and each BFS takes O(n) time in the worst case.\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the required distances and counts the pairs of houses for each distance.", "split": "test"}}

This will store the final average intensities.\n   - We also create a `count` grid to keep track of how many regions each pixel belongs to.\n\n2. **Helper Function `is_valid_region`**:\n   - This function checks if a 3x3 subgrid starting at `(x, y)` is a valid region based on the threshold.\n   - It checks the absolute difference between adjacent pixels in both horizontal and vertical directions.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible 3x3 Subgrids**:\n   - We iterate over all possible starting points `(i, j)` for 3x3 subgrids in the image.\n   - For each subgrid, we check if it is a valid region using `is_valid_region`.\n   - If it is valid, we calculate the average intensity of the subgrid and update the corresponding pixels in `result` and increment their count in `count`.\n\n4. **Calculate Final Result**:\n   - After processing all subgrids, we iterate over the `result` grid.\n   - For each pixel, if it belongs to any region (`count[i][j] > 0`), we compute the final average intensity by dividing the total intensity by the count.\n   - If a pixel does not belong to any region, we set it to its original intensity from the `image`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly compute the average intensity for each pixel based on the regions it belongs to, handling edge cases where a pixel does not belong to any region.", "split": "test"}}

The keys 2 to 9 can be remapped to any collection of letters, and each letter must be mapped to exactly one key. The goal is to distribute the letters in such a way that the total number of key presses is minimized.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Count the Frequency of Each Letter**: Since the word contains distinct letters, each letter appears exactly once. However, the problem can be generalized to handle words with repeated letters.\n\n2. **Optimal Key Assignment**: To minimize the number of key presses, we should aim to assign the most frequent letters to the keys that require the fewest presses. Specifically:\n   - The first 8 letters can be assigned to the keys 2 to 9, each requiring 1 press.\n   - The next 8 letters can be assigned to the same keys, each requiring 2 presses.\n   - The next 8 letters can be assigned to the same keys, each requiring 3 presses.\n   - And so on...\n\n3. **Calculate the Minimum Presses**: Given the distinct nature of the word, we can directly calculate the minimum number of presses based on the number of letters in the word.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above logic:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumPushes(self, word: str) -> int:\n        n = len(word)\n        # Calculate the minimum number of presses\n        # Each set of 8 letters can be typed with 1, 2, 3, ... presses\n        full_sets = n // 8\n        remaining_letters = n % 8\n        # Calculate the total presses for full sets\n        total_presses = sum(i * 8 for i in range(1, full_sets + 1))\n        # Add the presses for the remaining letters\n        total_presses += (full_sets + 1) * remaining_letters\n        return total_presses\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Full Sets Calculation**: We determine how many full sets of 8 letters can be accommodated. Each full set contributes `i * 8` presses, where `i` is the set number (starting from 1).\n- **Remaining Letters**: After handling full sets, any remaining letters are assigned to the next available key, each requiring `full_sets + 1` presses.\n- **Total Presses**: The sum of presses for full sets and remaining letters gives the total number of key presses required.\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the minimum number of key presses needed to type the given word by optimally remapping the keys.", "split": "test"}}

This ensures that for any pair of points, if the first point is to the left of the second point, it can potentially be the upper-left corner and the second point can be the lower-right corner.\n\n2. **Iterate Through Points**: For each point, consider it as the potential upper-left corner (Alice's position) and check all subsequent points to see if they can be the lower-right corner (Bob's position).\n\n3. **Check for Validity**: For each pair of points (upper-left and lower-right), ensure that no other point lies within or on the boundary of the rectangle formed by these two points. This can be efficiently checked by maintaining a variable that tracks the maximum y-coordinate encountered so far for the points with x-coordinates between the current upper-left and lower-right points.\n\n4. **Count Valid Pairs**: If a pair of points is valid, increment the count.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def numberOfPairs(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        # Sort points by x-coordinate, and by y-coordinate in descending order if x-coordinates are the same\n        points.sort(key=lambda p: (p[0], -p[1]))\n        \n        n = len(points)\n        count = 0\n        \n        # Iterate over each point as the potential upper-left corner\n        for i in range(n):\n            max_y = float('-inf')\n            # Check all subsequent points as the potential lower-right corner\n            for j in range(i + 1, n):\n                x1, y1 = points[i]\n                x2, y2 = points[j]\n                # Check if the current point can be the lower-right corner\n                if y2 <= y1 and y2 > max_y:\n                    count += 1\n                    max_y = y2\n        \n        return count\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Sorting**: Sorting the points ensures that we only need to consider subsequent points for each point as potential lower-right corners, which simplifies the problem.\n- **Two Loops**: The outer loop selects the upper-left corner, and the inner loop checks all possible lower-right corners.\n- **Max_y Check**: The `max_y` variable keeps track of the highest y-coordinate of the points that have been considered as potential lower-right corners. This ensures that no point is within or on the boundary of the rectangle formed by the current pair of points.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts the number of valid pairs in \\(O(n^2)\\) time, which is feasible for the problem constraints.", "split": "test"}}

The primary key for sorting is the x-coordinate (`x[0]`). For points with the same x-coordinate, we sort by the y-coordinate in descending order (`-x[1]`). This ensures that for points with the same x-coordinate, the point with the higher y-coordinate comes first.\n\n2. **Counting Valid Pairs**:\n   - We iterate through each point `A` (with coordinates `(x1, y1)`).\n   - For each point `A`, we initialize `max_y` to negative infinity.\n   - We then look at all subsequent points `B` (with coordinates `(x2, y2)`) in the sorted list.\n   - For a point `B` to form a valid pair with `A`, `y2` must be less than or equal to `y1` and greater than `max_y` (to ensure no other points are in between).\n   - If these conditions are met, we update `max_y` to `y2` and increment the count of valid pairs `ans`.\n\n3. **Return the Count**: Finally, we return the count of valid pairs.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count the valid pairs while maintaining the constraints of the problem.", "split": "test"}}

The operations involve removing the first `k` characters and appending any `k` characters to the end of the string at each second.\n\nThe key insight here is that we need to find the smallest period `T` such that after performing the operations `T` times, the string `word` returns to its original form. This means that the string `word` should be a concatenation of repeated substrings of length `k` in such a way that after `T` operations, the string aligns with its original form.\n\nTo achieve this, we can use the concept of the period of a string. The period of a string is the smallest positive integer `p` such that the string repeats every `p` characters. In this problem, we need to find the smallest `T` such that `word` can be considered as a repetition of a substring that fits the operations' constraints.\n\nHere's the implementation of the solution:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumTimeToInitialState(self, word: str, k: int) -> int:\n        n = len(word)\n        \n        # We need to find the smallest T such that T * k is a multiple of n\n        # and the string word[0:n-k*T] is a prefix of word[k*T:].\n        # This is equivalent to finding the smallest T such that word is a prefix of word shifted by T*k.\n        \n        # The idea is to find the smallest T such that word is a prefix of word shifted by T*k\n        for T in range(1, n // k + 1):\n            if word.startswith(word[T * k:]):\n                return T\n        \n        # If no such T is found, it means the string needs to be fully cycled\n        return n // k + 1\n\n# Example usage:\n# sol = Solution()\n# print(sol.minimumTimeToInitialState(\"abcd\", 2))  # Output: 2\n# print(sol.minimumTimeToInitialState(\"abab\", 2))  # Output: 2\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Loop through possible values of `T`:** We iterate over possible values of `T` from 1 to `n // k + 1`. The upper limit `n // k + 1` ensures that we cover all possible shifts.\n2. **Check if `word` is a prefix of the shifted string:** For each `T`, we check if `word` starts with the substring `word[T * k:]`. If it does, it means that after `T` operations, the string will have cycled back to its original form.\n3. **Return the smallest valid `T`:** As soon as we find such a `T`, we return it as the result.\n4. **Fallback case:** If no such `T` is found within the loop, it means the string needs to be fully cycled, and we return `n // k + 1`.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the minimum time required for the string to revert to its initial state.", "split": "test"}}

Specifically, we need to find the smallest `t` such that the string `word` can be split into segments of length `k` and rearranged in such a way that it matches the original string.\n   - This can be reduced to finding the smallest `t` such that `word` is a prefix of `word + word` starting from some position, and this position is determined by the periodicity of the string.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - We can use the concept of the prefix function (also known as the \"pi-function\") from the KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) string matching algorithm to determine the smallest `t`.\n   - The prefix function for a string `s` is an array `pi` where `pi[i]` is the length of the longest proper prefix of the substring `s[0...i]` which is also a suffix of this substring.\n   - We construct the prefix function for the string `word + '#' + word`, where `#` is a character not present in `word`. This helps in finding the longest prefix of `word` that matches a suffix of `word` after some number of segments.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We calculate the prefix function for `word + '#' + word`.\n   - The length of the longest prefix which is also a suffix will help us determine the periodicity of the string.\n   - The minimum time `t` will be the smallest number such that `k * t` is a multiple of the length of the string, and the remaining part of the string matches the prefix.\n\nHere is the implementation of the above logic:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumTimeToInitialState(self, word: str, k: int) -> int:\n        def prefix_function(s):\n            n = len(s)\n            pi = [0] * n\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                j = pi[i - 1]\n                while j > 0 and s[i] != s[j]:\n                    j = pi[j - 1]\n                if s[i] == s[j]:\n                    j += 1\n                pi[i] = j\n            return pi\n        \n        # Construct the string word + '#' + word\n        combined = word + '#' + word\n        pi = prefix_function(combined)\n        \n        # Length of the longest prefix which is also a suffix\n        longest_prefix_suffix = pi[-1]\n        \n        # The length of the repeating part\n        repeating_length = len(word) - longest_prefix_suffix\n        \n        # Find the smallest t such that k * t is a multiple of repeating_length\n        for t in range(1, repeating_length + 1):\n            if (k * t) % repeating_length == 0:\n                return t\n        \n        return len(word) // k  # Fallback, should not reach here due to logic\n\n# Example usage:\n# sol = Solution()\n# print(sol.minimumTimeToInitialState(\"abcd\", 2))  # Example test case\n```\n\nThis code calculates the minimum time required for the string to revert to its initial state by leveraging the prefix function to determine the periodicity of the string.", "split": "test"}}

It returns two values:\n  - `subtree_size`: The size of the subtree rooted at the current node.\n  - `valid`: A boolean indicating whether all nodes in the subtree have the same color as the current node.\n  \n- **Base Case**: For each node, we start with a `subtree_size` of 1 (the node itself) and assume the subtree is valid (`valid = True`).\n\n- **Recursive Case**: For each child of the current node, we recursively call `dfs`. If the child's subtree is valid and the child's color matches the current node's color, we add the child's subtree size to the current node's subtree size. If not, the current subtree is not valid.\n\n- **Update Maximum Size**: If the subtree rooted at the current node is valid, we update `max_size` if the current subtree size is larger.\n\n- **Return Value**: The function `dfs` is initially called with the root node (0) and a dummy parent (-1) to start the DFS traversal. The result is stored in `max_size`, which is returned as the final answer.", "split": "test"}}

The city is represented as a graph with houses as nodes and streets as edges. There is a direct street between each consecutive house, and an additional street between houses `x` and `y`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Model the Graph**: Represent the city as a graph with `n` nodes. Add edges between consecutive nodes (i.e., `i` to `i+1` for all `1 <= i <= n-1`). Also, add an edge between nodes `x` and `y`.\n\n2. **Shortest Paths Calculation**: For each pair of houses, calculate the shortest path between them. This can be efficiently done using Breadth-First Search (BFS) for each node.\n\n3. **Count Pairs by Distance**: Use the shortest paths to count how many pairs of houses have a distance of `k` for each `k`.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countOfPairs(self, n: int, x: int, y: int) -> List[int]:\n        def bfs(start):\n            distances = [-1] * (n + 1)\n            distances[start] = 0\n            queue = deque([start])\n            while queue:\n                current = queue.popleft()\n                for neighbor in [current - 1, current + 1]:\n                    if 1 <= neighbor <= n and distances[neighbor] == -1:\n                        distances[neighbor] = distances[current] + 1\n                        queue.append(neighbor)\n                if current == x and distances[y] == -1:\n                    distances[y] = distances[current] + 1\n                    queue.append(y)\n                elif current == y and distances[x] == -1:\n                    distances[x] = distances[current] + 1\n                    queue.append(x)\n            return distances\n        \n        result = [0] * n\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            distances = bfs(i)\n            for distance in distances:\n                if 1 <= distance <= n:\n                    result[distance - 1] += 1\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **BFS Function**: The `bfs` function calculates the shortest distance from a given start node to all other nodes in the graph. It uses a queue to explore the graph level by level, updating the distance to each node as it is reached.\n\n- **Main Loop**: For each house `i`, we calculate the shortest distances to all other houses using BFS. We then update the `result` array to count the number of pairs with each distance `k`.\n\n- **Edge Handling**: The BFS function explicitly checks for the additional edge between `x` and `y` to ensure that this edge is considered in the shortest path calculations.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the shortest paths and count the pairs for each distance, resulting in a solution that is both correct and efficient.", "split": "test"}}

For example, if numBottles == 3 and numExchange == 1, you cannot exchange 3 empty water bottles for 3 full bottles.\nReturn the maximum number of water bottles you can drink.\n \nPlease complete the following python code precisely:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def maxBottlesDrunk(self, numBottles: int, numExchange: int) -> int:\n```", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of drinking water bottles and exchanging empty bottles for full ones.

We can exchange `numExchange` empty bottles for one full bottle and then increase `numExchange` by one.\n4. We cannot exchange multiple batches of empty bottles for the same value of `numExchange`.\n\nThe goal is to maximize the number of bottles we can drink. Here's how we can implement this:\n\n- Initialize a counter to keep track of the total number of bottles drunk.\n- Use a loop to simulate the process of drinking and exchanging bottles.\n- In each iteration, drink all the full bottles, convert them to empty bottles, and then check if we can exchange any empty bottles for full ones.\n- Continue the process until we no longer have enough empty bottles to exchange for a full one.\n\nHere's the complete code:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def maxBottlesDrunk(self, numBottles: int, numExchange: int) -> int:\n        total_drunk = 0\n        empty_bottles = 0\n        \n        while numBottles > 0:\n            # Drink all the full bottles\n            total_drunk += numBottles\n            empty_bottles += numBottles\n            numBottles = 0\n            \n            # Exchange empty bottles for full ones if possible\n            if empty_bottles >= numExchange:\n                numBottles = 1  # Get one full bottle\n                empty_bottles -= numExchange\n                numExchange += 1  # Increase the exchange rate\n        \n        return total_drunk\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- `total_drunk` keeps track of the total number of bottles we have drunk.\n- `empty_bottles` keeps track of the number of empty bottles we currently have.\n- In each iteration of the loop:\n  - We drink all the full bottles, incrementing `total_drunk` by `numBottles` and converting them to empty bottles.\n  - We then check if we have enough empty bottles to exchange for a full one. If so, we perform the exchange, get one full bottle, and increase the exchange rate.\n- The loop continues until we no longer have enough empty bottles to make an exchange.", "split": "test"}}

During this process, we decrease the count of the character at the `left` pointer and remove it from the dictionary if its count reaches 0.\n\n4. **Update Maximum Length**: After adjusting the window, we update `max_length` with the current window size (`right - left + 1`).\n\n5. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return `max_length`, which contains the length of the longest substring with at most two occurrences of each character.", "split": "test"}}

For each element, we add `max(0, happiness[i] - i)` to the sum. The `max(0, ...)` ensures that the happiness value does not go negative.\n- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step, and `O(k)` for the summation, which is efficient given the constraints.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the sum of the happiness values of the selected children.", "split": "test"}}

Here's how we can approach this:\n\n1. **Hours (HH):**\n   - The first digit of the hour can be '0', '1', or '2', but since we are dealing with a 12-hour format, it can only be '0' or '1'.\n   - If the first digit is '2', the second digit can be '0' to '3'. However, in a 12-hour format, the first digit can only be '0' or '1', so the second digit can be '0' to '9' if the first digit is '0', and '0' to '1' if the first digit is '1'.\n   - If the first digit is '?', we should choose the largest possible valid digit. If the second digit is '0' to '3', the first digit can be '1'. Otherwise, it must be '0'.\n   - If the second digit is '?', we should choose the largest possible valid digit based on the first digit. If the first digit is '0', it can be '9'. If the first digit is '1', it can be '1'.\n\n2. **Minutes (MM):**\n   - The first digit of the minute can be '0' to '5'.\n   - The second digit of the minute can be '0' to '9'.\n   - If the first digit is '?', we should choose '5'.\n   - If the second digit is '?', we should choose '9'.\n\nLet's implement this logic in the `findLatestTime` method:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def findLatestTime(self, s: str) -> str:\n        s = list(s)  # Convert string to list for easier manipulation\n        \n        # Determine the first digit of the hour\n        if s[0] == '?':\n            if s[1] in '0123' or s[1] == '?':\n                s[0] = '1'\n            else:\n                s[0] = '0'\n        \n        # Determine the second digit of the hour\n        if s[1] == '?':\n            if s[0] == '1':\n                s[1] = '1'\n            else:\n                s[1] = '9'\n        \n        # Determine the first digit of the minute\n        if s[3] == '?':\n            s[3] = '5'\n        \n        # Determine the second digit of the minute\n        if s[4] == '?':\n            s[4] = '9'\n        \n        return ''.join(s)  # Convert list back to string\n```\n\nThis solution ensures that we replace each '?' with the largest possible digit that maintains a valid 12-hour time format, resulting in the latest possible time.", "split": "test"}}

Here's the complete code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumEnergy(self, energy: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        n = len(energy)\n        if n == 0:\n            return 0\n        \n        # dp[i] will store the maximum energy we can gain starting from index i\n        dp = [0] * n\n        \n        # Fill the dp array from the end to the beginning\n        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n            # If we can jump k steps forward, we take the maximum energy from that position\n            if i + k < n:\n                dp[i] = energy[i] + dp[i + k]\n            else:\n                dp[i] = energy[i]\n        \n        # The result is the maximum value in the dp array, which represents the maximum energy we can gain starting from any position\n        return max(dp)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: We create a `dp` array of the same length as `energy`, initialized to zero. This array will store the maximum energy we can gain starting from each position.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:\n   - We iterate over the `energy` array from the last element to the first.\n   - For each position `i`, if we can jump `k` steps forward (i.e., `i + k < n`), we set `dp[i]` to `energy[i] + dp[i + k]`. This means we take the energy from the current magician and add it to the maximum energy we can gain from the position we jump to.\n   - If we cannot jump `k` steps forward, we simply set `dp[i]` to `energy[i]`.\n\n3. **Result**: The maximum value in the `dp` array will be the maximum energy we can gain starting from any position.\n\nThis approach ensures that we consider all possible starting points and calculate the maximum energy gain efficiently with a time complexity of \\(O(n)\\).", "split": "test"}}

This is done by verifying if the sum of the shortest distance from node 0 to node `u`, the weight of the edge, and the shortest distance from node `v` to node n-1 equals the shortest distance from node 0 to node n-1. We perform this check in both directions (u to v and v to u) to ensure we capture all cases.\n\n4. **Result**: We append `True` to the result list if the edge is part of any shortest path, otherwise `False`.", "split": "test"}}

This is because the AND operation between any number and `x` will only keep the bits that are set in both numbers.\n\nTo minimize `nums[n - 1]`, we should start with the smallest possible numbers that satisfy the above condition.

The key observation here is that the string `s` must be divisible into segments where each segment is an anagram of `t`. Therefore, the length of `t` must be a divisor of the length of `s`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify Divisors**: Find all divisors of the length of `s`. These divisors represent possible lengths for `t`.\n\n2. **Check Each Divisor**: For each divisor, check if the string `s` can be split into segments of that length, where each segment is an anagram of the others.\n\n3. **Anagram Check**: To check if segments are anagrams, we can sort the characters in each segment and compare them.\n\n4. **Return the Minimum**: The smallest divisor that satisfies the condition is the minimum length of `t`.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above logic:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minAnagramLength(self, s: str) -> int:\n        def is_anagram_segmentation(s, length):\n            segment = s[:length]\n            sorted_segment = sorted(segment)\n            for i in range(length, len(s), length):\n                if sorted(s[i:i+length]) != sorted_segment:\n                    return False\n            return True\n        \n        n = len(s)\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            if n % i == 0 and is_anagram_segmentation(s, i):\n                return i\n        return n  # This line should never be reached if input is valid\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **is_anagram_segmentation**: This helper function checks if `s` can be split into segments of a given `length` where each segment is an anagram of the first segment. It sorts the first segment and compares it with the sorted version of each subsequent segment of the same length.\n\n- **Loop through divisors**: We loop through all numbers from 1 to `n` (length of `s`). For each number `i`, if `i` is a divisor of `n` (i.e., `n % i == 0`), we check if `s` can be segmented into anagrams of length `i` using the helper function.\n\n- **Return the smallest valid length**: The first valid length `i` that satisfies the condition is returned as the minimum length of `t`.", "split": "test"}}

Instead, we can use a more efficient approach by leveraging the properties of modular arithmetic.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n\n1. **Modular Arithmetic**: Instead of working with the actual hours, we can work with their remainders when divided by 24. This is because if two numbers sum to a multiple of 24, their remainders must also sum to 24 (or 0, considering that 0 and 24 are equivalent in this context).\n\n2. **Count Remainders**: We can count the occurrences of each remainder when the hours are divided by 24. This will help us quickly determine how many numbers can pair with each other to form a complete day.\n\n3. **Pairing Logic**:\n   - For a remainder `r`, it can pair with a remainder `24 - r` to form a complete day.\n   - Special cases are when the remainder is 0 or 12, as these can pair with themselves.\n\n4. **Efficient Counting**: Using the counts of each remainder, we can efficiently calculate the number of valid pairs.\n\nHere's the implementation of the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countCompleteDayPairs(self, hours: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Count the occurrences of each remainder when divided by 24\n        remainder_count = Counter(h % 24 for h in hours)\n        \n        complete_days = 0\n        \n        # Iterate over each possible remainder\n        for r in range(24):\n            if r == 0 or r == 12:\n                # Special case: pairs with itself\n                # If there are n such elements, we can form n*(n-1)/2 pairs\n                n = remainder_count[r]\n                complete_days += n * (n - 1) // 2\n            else:\n                # General case: pair with the complement remainder (24 - r)\n                complete_days += remainder_count[r] * remainder_count[24 - r]\n                # Mark this remainder as processed by setting its count to 0\n                remainder_count[24 - r] = 0\n        \n        return complete_days\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We use a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each remainder.\n- For each remainder `r` from 0 to 23:\n  - If `r` is 0 or 12, we calculate the number of ways to choose 2 elements from `n` elements, which is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.\n  - For other remainders, we multiply the count of `r` with the count of `24 - r` to get the number of valid pairs.\n  - We set `remainder_count[24 - r]` to 0 to avoid double counting in the next iterations.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts the pairs with a time complexity of \\(O(n)\\).", "split": "test"}}

This helps in determining how much more is needed to reach the next multiple of 24.\n\n2. **Complement Calculation**: For each remainder, we calculate its complement. The complement is the value that, when added to the current remainder, results in a multiple of 24. This is calculated as `(24 - remainder) % 24`.\n\n3. **Counting Pairs**: We use a dictionary `remainder_count` to keep track of how many times each remainder has appeared so far. For each hour, we look up how many times its complement has appeared before and add this to our count of valid pairs.\n\n4. **Updating the Dictionary**: After checking for pairs, we update the dictionary to include the current remainder.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count the pairs in linear time, O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `hours` list.", "split": "test"}}

For each query, we update the element in the array and then compute the maximum sum of a subsequence where no two adjacent elements are selected. This is a classic dynamic programming problem.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve it:\n\n1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We can use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index `i` with the constraint that no two adjacent elements are selected. The recurrence relation is:\n   - `dp[i] = max(nums[i] + dp[i-2], dp[i-1])`\n   - This means we either take the current element `nums[i]` and add it to the best sum we could get ending at `i-2`, or we skip the current element and take the best sum we could get ending at `i-1`.\n\n2. **Handling Queries**: For each query, we update the element in `nums` and then recompute the `dp` array from the updated position to the end of the array. This is because the update can affect the maximum sum starting from that position.\n\n3. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, we need to take the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumSumSubsequence(self, nums: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        n = len(nums)\n        \n        def compute_dp(start):\n            # Initialize dp array\n            dp = [0] * n\n            if start == 0:\n                dp[0] = nums[0]\n            if start <= 1:\n                if start <= 0: dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])\n                else: dp[1] = nums[1]\n            \n            # Compute dp values from start to end\n            for i in range(max(2, start), n):\n                dp[i] = max(nums[i] + dp[i-2], dp[i-1])\n            \n            return dp\n        \n        # Initial dp computation\n        dp = compute_dp(0)\n        \n        total_sum = 0\n        for pos, x in queries:\n            # Update nums[pos] to x\n            nums[pos] = x\n            \n            # Recompute dp from pos to end\n            if pos < n - 1:\n                dp[pos+1] = max(nums[pos+1], dp[pos])\n            if pos < n - 2:\n                dp[pos+2] = max(nums[pos+2] + dp[pos], dp[pos+1])\n            for i in range(max(pos + 3, 0), n):\n                dp[i] = max(nums[i] + dp[i-2], dp[i-1])\n            \n            # The result for this query is the max value in dp\n            total_sum = (total_sum + dp[-1]) % MOD\n        \n        return total_sum\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Initial DP Computation**: We first compute the `dp` array for the initial state of `nums`.\n- **Query Handling**: For each query, we update the specified element and recompute the `dp` values starting from that position. We only need to recompute from `pos+1` to the end because the update can only affect the subsequences starting from `pos+1`.\n- **Result Accumulation**: We accumulate the result of each query and take the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle each query efficiently while keeping the overall complexity manageable.", "split": "test"}}

A subarray is special if every pair of adjacent elements has different parity (i.e., one is even and the other is odd).\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to implement the `isArraySpecial` method:\n\n1. **Precompute Parity Information**: Instead of checking the parity for each element every time, we can precompute a boolean array where each element indicates whether the corresponding element in `nums` is odd (or even).\n\n2. **Check Subarrays**: For each query, check the precomputed parity array to see if every pair of adjacent elements in the subarray has different parity.\n\n3. **Return Results**: Collect the results for each query and return them as a list of booleans.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def isArraySpecial(self, nums: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[bool]:\n        # Precompute the parity of each element in nums\n        # True if odd, False if even\n        parity = [num % 2 == 1 for num in nums]\n        \n        results = []\n        \n        for start, end in queries:\n            is_special = True\n            for i in range(start, end):\n                if parity[i] == parity[i + 1]:\n                    is_special = False\n                    break\n            results.append(is_special)\n        \n        return results\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Parity Array**: We create a boolean array `parity` where `parity[i]` is `True` if `nums[i]` is odd and `False` if `nums[i]` is even. This allows us to quickly check the parity of any element.\n\n- **Query Processing**: For each query `[start, end]`, we iterate through the subarray from `start` to `end - 1` and check if consecutive elements have different parity. If we find any two consecutive elements with the same parity, we mark the subarray as not special and break out of the loop.\n\n- **Result Collection**: We append the result for each query to the `results` list, which is returned at the end.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem by leveraging precomputed parity information and ensures that each query is processed in linear time relative to the size of the subarray.", "split": "test"}}

Here's a step-by-step approach to implement the solution:\n\n1. **Iterate Over Possible Subarrays**: We need to consider all possible subarrays of `nums`. This can be done using two nested loops where the outer loop sets the starting index of the subarray and the inner loop sets the ending index.\n\n2. **Calculate Bitwise OR for Each Subarray**: For each subarray defined by the start and end indices, calculate the bitwise OR of its elements.\n\n3. **Track the Minimum Difference**: As we calculate the bitwise OR for each subarray, compute the absolute difference between `k` and this OR value. Keep track of the minimum difference encountered.\n\n4. **Return the Minimum Difference**: After evaluating all subarrays, return the smallest absolute difference found.\n\nHere's the complete implementation of the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumDifference(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        min_diff = float('inf')\n        n = len(nums)\n        \n        # Iterate over all possible starting points of subarrays\n        for start in range(n):\n            current_or = 0\n            # Iterate over all possible ending points of subarrays starting from 'start'\n            for end in range(start, n):\n                # Calculate the bitwise OR of the subarray nums[start:end+1]\n                current_or |= nums[end]\n                # Calculate the absolute difference\n                diff = abs(k - current_or)\n                # Update the minimum difference\n                min_diff = min(min_diff, diff)\n                # If the current difference is zero, we can't get a smaller difference, so return it immediately\n                if diff == 0:\n                    return 0\n        \n        return min_diff\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Initialization**: We initialize `min_diff` to infinity to ensure any valid difference will be smaller.\n- **Nested Loops**: The outer loop (`start`) iterates over each possible starting index of a subarray. The inner loop (`end`) iterates from the current `start` to the end of the array, defining the subarray `nums[start:end+1]`.\n- **Bitwise OR Calculation**: For each subarray, we update `current_or` by taking the bitwise OR with the current element `nums[end]`.\n- **Difference Calculation**: We calculate the absolute difference between `k` and `current_or` and update `min_diff` if this difference is smaller.\n- **Early Exit**: If at any point the difference is zero, we can return immediately as this is the smallest possible difference.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of \\(O(n^2)\\) due to the nested loops, where \\(n\\) is the length of the `nums` array. This is efficient enough for moderate-sized arrays.", "split": "test"}}

The distance between these two nodes is the diameter of the tree.\n\n2. **Calculate the Diameter for Each Tree**: Calculate the diameter of each tree separately.\n\n3. **Connect the Trees**: When connecting one node from the first tree to another node from the second tree, the diameter of the resulting tree can be influenced by:\n   - The original diameters of the two trees.\n   - The new path created by the connection.\n\n4. **Calculate the New Diameter**: For each pair of nodes (one from each tree), calculate the new diameter if they are connected. The new diameter can be:\n   - The maximum of the original diameters.\n   - The sum of the distances from the chosen node in the first tree to its farthest leaf, plus the distance from the chosen node in the second tree to its farthest leaf, plus 1 (for the new edge).\n\n5. **Minimize the New Diameter**: Iterate over all possible pairs of nodes from the two trees and keep track of the minimum new diameter.\n\nHere is the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumDiameterAfterMerge(self, edges1: List[List[int]], edges2: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        from collections import defaultdict\n        \n        def dfs(graph, start, parent):\n            max_depth = 0\n            for neighbor in graph[start]:\n                if neighbor != parent:\n                    max_depth = max(max_depth, dfs(graph, neighbor, start) + 1)\n            return max_depth\n        \n        def find_diameter(graph):\n            # Find the farthest node from node 0\n            _, farthest_node = max((dfs(graph, node, -1), node) for node in graph)\n            # Find the diameter starting from the farthest node\n            diameter = dfs(graph, farthest_node, -1)\n            return diameter\n        \n        # Build adjacency lists for both trees\n        graph1 = defaultdict(list)\n        graph2 = defaultdict(list)\n        \n        for u, v in edges1:\n            graph1[u].append(v)\n            graph1[v].append(u)\n        \n        for u, v in edges2:\n            graph2[u].append(v)\n            graph2[v].append(u)\n        \n        # Calculate the diameters of the two trees\n        diameter1 = find_diameter(graph1)\n        diameter2 = find_diameter(graph2)\n        \n        # Calculate the maximum depth from each node to any leaf in its tree\n        max_depth1 = {node: dfs(graph1, node, -1) for node in graph1}\n        max_depth2 = {node: dfs(graph2, node, -1) for node in graph2}\n        \n        # Try connecting each node in graph1 to each node in graph2 and find the minimum new diameter\n        min_diameter = float('inf')\n        \n        for node1 in graph1:\n            for node2 in graph2:\n                new_diameter = max(diameter1, diameter2, max_depth1[node1] + max_depth2[node2] + 1)\n                min_diameter = min(min_diameter, new_diameter)\n        \n        return min_diameter\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the minimum possible diameter of the resulting tree after merging the two trees by considering all possible connections and their impact on the diameter.", "split": "test"}}

The key idea is to use a bitmask to keep track of the possible sums we can achieve. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:\n\n1. **Remove Duplicates and Sort**: We start by removing any duplicate values from `rewardValues` and sort the remaining values. This helps in efficiently calculating the possible sums.\n\n2. **Bitmask Representation**: We use a bitmask `f` to represent the possible sums we can achieve. Initially, `f` is set to 1, which represents that we can achieve the sum 0 (no elements selected).\n\n3. **Iterate Through Sorted Values**: For each value `v` in the sorted list of unique reward values:\n   - We update the bitmask `f` by considering all sums that can be formed by adding `v` to the sums already represented in `f`.\n   - This is done using the expression `f |= (f & ((1 << v) - 1)) << v`. Here, `f & ((1 << v) - 1)` gives us the bitmask of all sums less than `v` that can be formed, and shifting this by `v` positions to the left gives us the new sums that can be formed by adding `v` to these sums.\n\n4. **Determine the Maximum Sum**: Finally, the maximum sum we can achieve is represented by the highest bit set in the bitmask `f`. This is calculated using `f.bit_length() - 1`.\n\nHere's the complete code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maxTotalReward(self, rewardValues: List[int]) -> int:\n        nums = sorted(set(rewardValues))\n        f = 1\n        for v in nums:\n            f |= (f & ((1 << v) - 1)) << v\n        return f.bit_length() - 1\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Bitmask Update:\n- `f & ((1 << v) - 1)`: This operation extracts the lower `v` bits of `f`, representing all sums less than `v` that can be formed.\n- `(f & ((1 << v) - 1)) << v`: This shifts these sums by `v` positions to the left, effectively adding `v` to each of these sums.\n- `f |= ...`: This updates `f` to include these new sums.\n\nBy following this approach, we efficiently compute the maximum total reward that can be collected.", "split": "test"}}

If the result is zero, it means `nums1[i]` is divisible by `nums2[j] * k`, and we increment the `count`.\n\n4. **Return Result**: After iterating through all pairs, we return the `count` which represents the total number of good pairs.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n * m), where `n` is the length of `nums1` and `m` is the length of `nums2`.

The goal is to return the lexicographically smallest resulting string after all '*' characters have been removed.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to implement the solution:\n\n1. Convert the string `s` into a list of characters for easier manipulation.\n2. Use a loop to repeatedly find and remove the leftmost '*' and the smallest non-'*' character to its left.\n3.

This will help us determine the bounding boxes (rectangles) that can cover these `1`s.\n\n2. **Determine the bounding boxes**: For each `1` in the grid, we need to determine the smallest possible rectangle that can cover it.

This represents the minimum cost to form each prefix of the target string.\n   - `dp[0]` is set to `0` because the cost to form an empty string is zero.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:\n   - For each position `i` in the target string (from `1` to `n`), we check each word in the `words` array.\n   - If the word can fit into the current position (i.e., `i >= len(word)`) and matches the substring `target[i - len(word):i]`, we update `dp[i]` to be the minimum of its current value and the cost of forming the prefix up to `i - len(word)` plus the cost of appending the current word.\n\n3. **Result**:\n   - After filling the `dp` array, `dp[n]` will contain the minimum cost to form the entire target string. If `dp[n]` is still `float('inf')`, it means it's not possible to form the target string using the given words, and we return `-1`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we consider all possible ways to form the target string using the given words and find the minimum cost among them.", "split": "test"}}

We store these sizes in a list `subtree_sizes`.\n\n4. **Good Node Check**: After calculating the sizes of all subtrees of a node, we check if all sizes are the same. If they are, the node is a good node.\n\n5. **Count Good Nodes**: We maintain a counter `good_nodes_count` to keep track of the number of good nodes.\n\n6. **DFS Initialization**: We start the DFS from the root node (0) and initialize the parent as -1 (indicating no parent).\n\nThis solution efficiently counts the number of good nodes in the tree using a single DFS traversal.", "split": "test"}}

For a subsequence to be valid, the parity of the sum of every pair of consecutive elements must be the same.\n   - This means that for any two consecutive elements `sub[i]` and `sub[i+1]`, `(sub[i] + sub[i+1]) % 2` should be the same for all pairs.\n\n2. **Transform the Problem**:\n   - We can transform the problem by considering the parity of each element itself. Specifically, we can check if the difference between consecutive elements is even or odd.\n   - If `nums[i]` and `nums[i+1]` have the same parity, then `(nums[i] + nums[i+1]) % 2` will be the same as `(nums[i] - nums[i+1]) % 2`.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:\n   - We can use a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the longest valid subsequence ending at each index.\n   - We maintain two counters: one for the longest subsequence ending at an even parity and one for the longest subsequence ending at an odd parity.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - Iterate through the array and for each element, check its parity.\n   - Update the counters based on the parity of the current element and the previous element.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        if not nums:\n            return 0\n        \n        # Initialize counters for the longest subsequence ending in even and odd parity\n        even_count = 1\n        odd_count = 1\n        \n        # Iterate through the array starting from the second element\n        for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n            if (nums[i] % 2) == (nums[i - 1] % 2):\n                # If the current and previous elements have the same parity\n                even_count += 1\n            else:\n                # If the current and previous elements have different parities\n                odd_count += 1\n        \n        # The result is the maximum of the two counters\n        return max(even_count, odd_count)\n\n# Example usage:\n# sol = Solution()\n# print(sol.maximumLength([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: 2\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We initialize `even_count` and `odd_count` to 1 because a single element is a valid subsequence.\n- As we iterate through the list, we check if the current element and the previous element have the same parity.\n- If they do, we increment the counter that corresponds to the current subsequence's parity.\n- If they don't, we switch to the other parity counter and increment it.\n- Finally, we return the maximum of the two counters, which represents the length of the longest valid subsequence.", "split": "test"}}

If both conditions are satisfied, we increment the count.\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of \\(O(n^4)\\) in the worst case, where \\(n\\) is the maximum of the number of rows and columns.

This allows us to always consider the most expensive cut first, which helps in minimizing the total cost.\n2. **Initialization**: We initialize `ans` to store the total cost, `i` and `j` to iterate through the cuts, and `h` and `v` to keep track of the number of segments in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively.\n3. **Iterative Cutting**: We iterate through the cuts and always choose the more expensive cut between the available horizontal and vertical cuts. This ensures that we are maximizing the cost reduction at each step.\n4. **Updating Segments**: After making a cut, we update the number of segments in the respective direction and move to the next cut.\n5. **Termination**: The loop terminates when all cuts have been made, and we return the total cost stored in `ans`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we get the minimum total cost to cut the entire cake into 1 x 1 pieces.", "split": "test"}}

Initially, both are set to 1 because the cake starts as one piece with height 1 and width 1.\n\n3. **Processing Cuts**:\n   - We use a `while` loop to process all cuts until all horizontal and vertical cuts have been considered.\n   - In each iteration, we check if there are no more vertical cuts left (`j == len(verticalCut)`) or if the current horizontal cut is more costly than the current vertical cut (`horizontalCut[i] > verticalCut[j]`). If either condition is true, we make a horizontal cut.\n   - If a horizontal cut is made, we add the cost of the cut multiplied by the current width `v` to `ans` and increase the height `h`.\n   - Otherwise, we make a vertical cut, add the cost of the cut multiplied by the current height `h` to `ans`, and increase the width `v`.\n\n4. **Return the Result**:\n   - After processing all cuts, `ans` contains the minimum total cost to cut the cake into 1x1 pieces.\n\nThis approach ensures that we always make the most cost-effective cut at each step, leading to the minimum total cost.", "split": "test"}}

Alice wins if the sum of the numbers she chooses is strictly greater than the sum of the numbers Bob gets.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. Calculate the sum of all single-digit numbers in `nums`.\n2. Calculate the sum of all double-digit numbers in `nums`.\n3. Calculate the total sum of all numbers in `nums`.\n4. If Alice chooses all single-digit numbers, then Bob gets all the double-digit numbers and the remaining single-digit numbers that Alice didn't choose. So, Alice's sum is the sum of single-digit numbers, and Bob's sum is the total sum minus Alice's sum.\n5. If Alice chooses all double-digit numbers, then Bob gets all the single-digit numbers and the remaining double-digit numbers that Alice didn't choose. So, Alice's sum is the sum of double-digit numbers, and Bob's sum is the total sum minus Alice's sum.\n6. Check if either of Alice's sums is greater than Bob's corresponding sum.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above logic in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def canAliceWin(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:\n        sum_single_digit = 0\n        sum_double_digit = 0\n        \n        for num in nums:\n            if 1 <= num <= 9:\n                sum_single_digit += num\n            elif 10 <= num <= 99:\n                sum_double_digit += num\n        \n        total_sum = sum(nums)\n        \n        # Alice chooses all single-digit numbers\n        alice_sum_single = sum_single_digit\n        bob_sum_single = total_sum - alice_sum_single\n        \n        # Alice chooses all double-digit numbers\n        alice_sum_double = sum_double_digit\n        bob_sum_double = total_sum - alice_sum_double\n        \n        # Check if Alice can win by choosing either single-digit or double-digit numbers\n        return alice_sum_single > bob_sum_single or alice_sum_double > bob_sum_double\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the required sums and checks the conditions to determine if Alice can win the game.", "split": "test"}}

We store this result in the `result` list.\n\n4. **Return Result**: After processing all queries, we return the `result` list, which contains the shortest path lengths after each query.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the shortest path after each update, leveraging the properties of Dijkstra's algorithm.", "split": "test"}}
